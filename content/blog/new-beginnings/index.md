# Finally...
Welp... many, many years after actually registering the securitypedant.com domain, i'm putting it to some use.

In 2023 I started at Cloudflare and have been learning a bucket load of new technology. Docker, Kubernates, Terraform not to mention the vast array of capabilities that is Cloudflare.

So i've made a few useful projects and gone over a few bumps. I thought I should be documenting some of these such that I can a) remember them myself as I work along and b) share them so others can avoid their own bumpy roads.

This is the first step. I just built out a Docker image designed to run in any containerized enviornment and allow you to use a CLoudflare tunnel to get to a shell and poke around the containerized network. I'll write that all up soon enough.
